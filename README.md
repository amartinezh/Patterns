# Patterns

This project will give us a basic idea of the *different software design patterns*.

To run the project you will need to use Apache Netbeans, you can find it at https://netbeans.apache.org/

In *software engineering*, a software design pattern is a general, **reusable solution** to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms. Efforts have also been made to codify design patterns in particular domains, including use of existing design patterns as well as domain specific design patterns.

Design patterns had originally been categorized into 3 sub-classifications based on kind of problem they solve. Creational patterns provide the capability to create objects based on a required criterion and in a controlled way. Structural patterns are about organizing different classes and objects to form larger structures and provide new functionality. Finally, behavioral patterns are about identifying common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns.

In this project, you will find design patterns, these are divided into three fundamental groups:
* Behavioral
* Creational
* Structural

## Creational Patterns
Creational patterns are used to create objects for a suitable class that serves as a solution for a problem. Generally when instances of several different classes are available. 

## Structural Patterns
Structural patterns form larger structures from individual parts, generally of different classes. Vary a great deal depending on what sort of structure is being created for what purpose. Too are concerned with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures.

## Behavioral patterns
Behavioral patterns describe interactions between objects and focus on how objects communicate with each other. They can reduce complex flow charts to mere interconnections between objects of various classes. Behavioral patterns are also used to make the algorithm that a class uses simply another parameter that is adjustable at runtime.
